# 🕵️‍♂️ On the Trail

### Step into the shoes of a detective in this AI-powered mystery game! 🤖🕵️

- ✨ <b>Every case is unique!</b> At the start, 4 characters, a gripping plot, and a location are randomly generated - no two mysteries are ever the same.
- 👥 <b>Meet unforgettable characters!</b> Each one is distinct, with special traits - you could talk to a grandma, a brave knight, or even an angel! Gather clues, ask questions, and try to uncover the culprit… but beware! Every character has a stress level, and if you push them too far, they’ll refuse to talk to you.
- 💬 <b>AI-driven conversations!</b> Powered by OpenAI, every dialogue feels alive, unpredictable, and immersive. Your detective skills are the key to cracking the case.
